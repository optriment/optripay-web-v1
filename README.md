# OptriPay Contracts V1

Welcome to OptriPay, a decentralized marketplace web application built for
educational purposes. This project allows sellers to create and sell their own
items, with all data securely stored on the blockchain. Please note that the
existing codebase has not been audited, and this version represents our initial
concept of creating a marketplace using crypto payments (USDT on Tron).

## Features

1. **Platform Fees:** A fee of 1-5% of the item's price will be charged from
   the seller for each transaction.
2. **Beneficiary Configuration:** The contract's owner has the ability to
   change the beneficiary of the service fee.
3. **Seller Functionality:** Sellers can add new items, update existing items,
   list their own items for sale, and view the purchases made on their items.
   Additionally, sellers can track their total income from sales.
4. **Buyer Functionality:** Buyers can purchase a specific item multiple times
   and view their own purchase history.
5. **Platform Owner Control:** The platform owner has the authority to change
   the platform's commission fee, set a new beneficiary for the service fee,
   and monitor the total income generated by the platform.
